        <![CDATA[A <b>Swiss-system tournament</b> is a non-eliminating tournament format which features a predetermined number of rounds of competition, but considerably fewer than in a round-robin tournament. In a Swiss tournament, each competitor (team or individual) does not play every other. Competitors meet one-to-one in each round and are paired using a predetermined set of rules designed to ensure that each competitor plays opponents with a similar running score, but not the same opponent more than once. The winner is the competitor with the highest aggregate points earned in all rounds. All competitors play in each round unless there is an odd number of them.

        <![CDATA[Based off of reality competition game shows which follow the format of non-tournament elimination contests. In many cases, participants are removed until only one person or team remains, who is then declared the winner. Usually this is done by eliminating participants one at a time (or sometimes two at a time, as an episodic twist due to the number of contestants involved and the length of a given season).

    \n\nPriority based:
    \n\nRank based on the number of wins or losses or ties in some order.  EG If the order is wins, ties, losses, then to compare the rank of A and B,  do the following. Compare A\'s win count with B\'s win count and whichever is more is ranked higher. If the same, compare A\'s tie count with B\'s tie count and whichever is more is ranked higher. If the same, compare A\'s loss count with B\'s loss count and whichever is more is ranked lower.
    \n\nScoring based:
    \n\nRank based on the amount of points accumulated where more means higher ranked. Points are assigned per win and loss and tie.  EG If a win is worth 2 points, a tie is worth 1 point and a loss is worth 0 points, then to compare the rank of A and B, count the number of wins, losses and ties for both and calculate the total points.
